        <main>Muscat is the capital city of Oman. It had a long history extending back to antiquity and good business
            ties to many nations, particularly in southeast Africa like Zanzibar.
            It is a lovely spot to visit where you can interact with hospitable locals and take a trip around the
            amazing sea-surrounded mountains.

        <main>One of the oldest markets in Oman is Souq Matrah. It is located in Muscat and well-known for selling
            cultural items including traditional clothing for men and women.
            You can stroll through the market, purchase interesting products, and enjoy the wonderful aroma of Arabic
            incense.

        <main>The most well-liked traditional dish in Oman is shuwa. It is frequently prepared during festive occasions
            like Eid.
            It is made of cow or sheep meat that has been marinated with various spices and kept in a fire hole for 24
            hours before being consumed. It goes well with salad and rice.
