            At Stone Town, the capital city of Zanzibar, one can find several historical structures dating back hundreds
            of years, including the House of Wonders, which was built during the Sultanate (Omani empire).
            You can go inside the building, hang out in the neighborhood, chat with locals, and buy some amazing African
            goods.

            One of the world's most magnificent islands is Prison Island. This lovely location was intended to house
            infected people as captives, but it was never able to do so. It was then transformed into a tourist
            attraction.
            Renting a boat allows you to travel to the island, where you may swim at a gorgeous beach, snap pictures
            with turtles, and spend the night.

            You definitely don't want to skip the delicious grilledÂ seafood from Zanzibar.
            You can sample a variety of sea species, such as octopus, prawns, squid, lobsters, and oysters, at
            Forodhani, a location destinated close to the prison island.
