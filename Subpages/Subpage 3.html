            Paella is unquestionably one of the most popular foods in Spain. It is made with soft rice, olives, lemon,
            and either chicken or seafood.
            But you should be aware that it's a bit salty. The free appetizers that come with bread, Spanish cheese, and
            the best olives in the world are what make this more intriguing.
